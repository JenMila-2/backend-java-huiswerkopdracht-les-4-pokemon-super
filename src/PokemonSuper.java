public abstract class PokemonSuper {



}

//NOTES
//PokemonSuper is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated, but we can create subclasses from it.
//We cannot create objects of an abstract class.
//All the abstract methods in the (PokemonSuper) abstract class need to be implemented in the subclasses (inheritance).
//A subclass must override all abstract methods of an abstract class.
//If a subclass doesn't provide the implementation (override) of the abstract method, then the subclass should also be declared as abstract.
//Why do we use abstract classes? To achieve abstraction (hide unnecessary details and only show the needed information).
